Making simple fetch call in react

State in react, 
-> They are treated as immutable( We cannot modify the state )
-> Every changes in the state re renders the particular class component
-> Use setState() to modify the state in class 
-> setState has access to two parameters -> previous props & props for the components



Assignemnet -> check on the code pen example and lifecycle methods

TODO: 
we try displaying the posts array data to cards one fetch is done

Things learnt today 
        Fetch call for the post and displaying the data using map.

        componentDidMount
        used this.setState

Task: 

1. Handling events and FORM In React : https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html

2. can we make the setState work synchronously as its asyncronous action.



Yestarday Assignemnet Discussion : 



            Siva B ;
                Arrow function: binding function to class component is advantagous in working with React Class based component
                Props: tranfer data from one to another component
                state in React : this.state object in constructor method of class component, incase of function we hooks of useState



lifecycle method

            Mounting , -> componentDidMount 
            Unmounting -> componentWillUnMount, componentDidUnMount
            Update     -> componentDidUpdate, componentWillMount

    Creating Post component , sending data through props


    Future CRUD operation on POSTS Site


    Making our first simple Post component 
    What why when to use component in react?
        What is component -> Simple peice of function or code block , that performs a specified Task
        why component -> Reuse 
        when component -> in our case post card is being created multiple times so better to segergate the logic for building single post into separate component
