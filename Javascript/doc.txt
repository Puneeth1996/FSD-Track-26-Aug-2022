Introduction to Javascrpit 



    What Is Javascrpit? - Programming language , 1997, ES6 version, interactions, light wieght, 


    Is Object Oriented Programming, Scripting Language : Ans Both


    Why Javascrpit is THE MOST LOVED LANGUAGE & THE MOST HATED LANGUAGE.
    hated :  lot of lines , 
    Liked : simple and easly to understand and write in javscript , 


    Remberer[Hosted] : When react, lets you debug some write you would see a lot of code that not written, and might be comming from other frameworks or library.



    History Of Javascrpit
    1997, Brendan Eich( From the Days of Netscape ) ,  
    ECMA Script, ECMA is desciding body of mainting standard of JS

Three Ways of Writing javscript code in html 
    1. Inline 2. Js File 3. Creating Script Tag in the HTML Document


Keywords : Reserved Words in Javascript 

Variable and Declaration

    we can use : var, const , let | To store Primitve Data Type : Number , string , Boolean ,
    const ( variable name defined with const connect take be changed once its defined )
    var and let ( variable names defined here can be modified to take up different types of data say strings or number or Boolean )
    

    Difference Between Null And Undefined 
    Undefined : This is seen when a variable name is defined and not assigned with any value to it 
    Null : This is a manual assignment , wherein the type of data is null


Operators In Javascript

    assignment ( = )

    ASSIGNMENET TOPIC ------>    Arithemetic Operators (  + , - , / , * , % ) 

    Conditional Operators ( < , > , <= , >= , !=, == , === , !== )

    Unary Operators ( ++ , -- )

    Logical Operators ( && , || )

    Ternary Operators ( ? : ) - Also Inline If conditiona
        true ? console.log("This is Fine") : console.log("Failed Script");
        VM2312:1 This is Fine
        undefined
        false ? console.log("This is Fine") : console.log("Failed Script");
        VM2385:1 Failed Script
        undefined

                        Use the below test 
                        https://api.publicapis.org/entries?title=bu&description=dip

        Good => All topics are covered Javascript
        Bad  => (Learners -> Not interactive.)(Teachers -> No Live examples been shown. Only the basic examples were presented, which are to be used fully in real time projects)

        Siva2 
        Good => Same as Siva1
        Bad  => (Learners -> Not understanding certain parts of javscrpit, working on it with other learners help.)(Teachers -> )
